**Issue:** Implement load-adaptive frame pacing to maintain crystal-clear playback during peak traffic surges.

**Priority:** High

**Description:**
- Develop a system for dynamically adjusting frame pacing based on load to prevent dropped frames and audio drift.
- Ensure perfect synchronicity between glyph overlays, whispers, and HUD elements.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Frame pacing adapts dynamically to load conditions.
2. No perceptible audio drift or dropped frames during stress tests.
3. Full synchronicity maintained between glyph overlays, whispers, and HUD.
