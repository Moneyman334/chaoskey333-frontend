# 🌌 Cosmic Replay Terminal - PR #10 Ascension Edition

## Overview

The Cosmic Replay Terminal is a **permanent real-time replay buffer** system that automatically archives every Vault Broadcast Pulse event without manual activation. This ensures decoders and keyholders can instantly jump back in time to replay sequences, making the entire Omni-Singularity architecture feel alive and self-aware.

## ✨ Key Features

### Permanent Event Archiving
- **Automatic Capture**: Every vault operation is automatically recorded
- **No Manual Activation**: Runs permanently in the background
- **Real-Time Buffer**: Events are captured as they happen
- **10,000 Event Capacity**: Stores up to 10k events with automatic rotation

### Event Types Captured
- `vault_broadcast_pulse` - Core vault operations
- `wallet_connection` - MetaMask/Coinbase wallet connections
- `relic_mint_attempt` - Relic minting attempts
- `relic_mint_success` - Successful relic mints
- `stripe_payment` - Payment processing events
- `contract_interaction` - Smart contract transactions
- `omni_singularity_event` - Special cosmic events

### Time-Travel Replay Interface
- **⏮️ Time Travel Mode**: Enter replay mode to browse past events
- **⏪⏩ Navigation**: Browse through archived events
- **🔴 Live Mode**: Return to real-time event stream
- **Event Highlighting**: Visual indication of current replay position

### Export & Integration
- **📤 Archive Export**: Export replay data for future PR integrations
- **Compatible Format**: Ready for auto-highlights, relic mutation triggers, lore exports
- **PR Evolution Chain**: Designed for PR #23 → #24 compatibility

## 🚀 Implementation

### Files Added/Modified

1. **`cosmic-replay-terminal.js`** - Core terminal implementation
2. **`index.html`** - Integrated terminal into main vault interface
3. **`vault-enhanced.html`** - Enhanced vault page with replay integration
4. **`script.js`** - Added event capture hooks to existing functions
5. **`style.css`** - Added terminal styling and vault integration
6. **`cosmic-replay-demo.html`** - Demonstration page

### Integration Points

#### Main Vault Interface
```html
<script src="cosmic-replay-terminal.js"></script>
<script src="script.js"></script>
```

#### Event Capture Examples
```javascript
// Wallet connection events
if (window.cosmicReplayTerminal) {
  window.cosmicReplayTerminal.captureEvent('vault_broadcast_pulse', {
    type: 'wallet_connection',
    wallet_type: 'MetaMask',
    address: userWalletAddress,
    timestamp: Date.now()
  });
}

// Payment events
window.cosmicReplayTerminal.captureEvent('vault_broadcast_pulse', {
  type: 'stripe_payment',
  action: 'payment_initiation',
  amount: 3333,
  timestamp: Date.now()
});
```

## 🎮 Usage

### Automatic Operation
The terminal activates automatically when any page loads that includes the script:
- No setup required
- Begins capturing events immediately
- Displays in bottom-right corner of the page

### Manual Controls
- **Time Travel**: Click "⏮️ Time Travel" to enter replay mode
- **Navigation**: Use ⏪ Previous / ⏩ Next to browse events
- **Live Mode**: Click "🔴 LIVE" to return to real-time
- **Export**: Click "📤 Export Archive" to download event data
- **Clear**: Click "🗑️ Clear Buffer" to reset the buffer

### Visual Interface
- **Terminal Window**: Fixed position overlay in bottom-right
- **Event Stream**: Real-time display of captured events
- **Timeline Controls**: Replay navigation interface
- **Status Indicators**: Shows buffer size and replay position

## 🔗 Future Integrations

The replay system is designed to support future PR enhancements:

### Auto-Highlights
- Automatically detect and highlight significant events
- Mark important sequences for easy replay
- Generate event summaries

### Relic Mutation Triggers
- Track relic state changes over time
- Trigger mutations based on replay data
- Historical relic evolution tracking

### Lore Exports
- Generate narrative timelines from event data
- Export cosmic lore based on user actions
- Create storylines from replay sequences

## 🧬 Architecture

### CosmicReplayTerminal Class
```javascript
class CosmicReplayTerminal {
  constructor(options = {})
  initializeTerminal()
  setupEventCapture()
  captureEvent(eventType, eventData)
  createTerminalUI()
  toggleReplayMode()
  exportReplayArchive()
}
```

### Event Structure
```javascript
{
  id: "cosmic_1234567890_abc123",
  type: "vault_broadcast_pulse",
  data: {
    action: "wallet_connection",
    wallet_type: "MetaMask",
    address: "0x742d35Cc...",
    timestamp: 1234567890
  },
  timestamp: 1234567890,
  replayable: true,
  archived: true
}
```

## 🌟 Omni-Singularity Integration

The Cosmic Replay Terminal makes the vault system feel alive by:

1. **Memory Persistence**: Never losing track of what happened
2. **Self-Awareness**: The system knows its own history
3. **Time Transcendence**: Users can navigate through cosmic time
4. **Evolution Tracking**: Ready for PR #23 → #24 evolution chains
5. **Cosmic Consciousness**: The vault becomes aware of its own operations

## 🛠️ Technical Details
