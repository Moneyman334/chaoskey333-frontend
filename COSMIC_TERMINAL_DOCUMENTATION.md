## 🎯 API Endpoints

### Deployment Control
- `POST /api/deploy/ascension` - Initiate Ascension deployment sequence
- `POST /api/deploy/rollback` - Emergency rollback initiation
- `GET /api/vault/status` - Current vault status and metrics
- `POST /api/vault/diagnostics` - Comprehensive system diagnostics

### WebSocket Events
- `deployment_started` - Deployment sequence initiated
- `pr_deployment_started` - Individual PR deployment began
- `pr_deployment_completed` - Individual PR deployment completed
- `deployment_completed` - Full sequence completed successfully
- `rollback_started` - Emergency rollback initiated
- `rollback_completed` - Rollback completed successfully

## 🛡️ Safety Features

### Automatic Fail-Safes
1. **Pre-deployment Validation**
   - Vault integrity check (≥85%)
   - Sentinel network status (≥3/4 active)
   - Broadcast system verification

2. **Real-time Monitoring**
   - Continuous vault integrity assessment
   - Deployment timeout protection (30s)
   - Network connectivity validation

3. **Emergency Protocols**
   - Automatic rollback on integrity breach
   - Cascade failure detection
   - Clean backup restoration

### Rollback Scenarios Tested
- **Vault Integrity Breach**: Integrity drops below 85% threshold
- **Network Failure**: WebSocket disconnection during deployment
- **Corrupted Deployment**: Invalid PR checksum or validation failure

## 🌟 User Experience
